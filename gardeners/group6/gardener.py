Group 6 Gardener: Force-directed layout with nutrient-aware optimization.

Strategy:
1. Random seed initial positions
2. Force layout (feasibility): Remove overlaps
3. Force layout (nutrient): Pull cross-species plants into interaction range
4. Multi-start: Try multiple seeds, pick best by simple graph score
